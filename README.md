# Spring Boot Book API

This is a simple Spring Boot RESTful API that manages a collection of books. The application provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to handle books in a library. You can filter books by category and interact with them through HTTP endpoints.

## Features

- **GET /api/books** - Retrieve all books or filter books by category.
- **GET /api/books/{title}** - Retrieve a specific book by its title.
- **POST /api/books/create** - Add a new book to the collection.
- **PUT /api/books/{title}** - Update an existing book by its title.
- **DELETE /api/books/{title}** - Delete a book by its title.
